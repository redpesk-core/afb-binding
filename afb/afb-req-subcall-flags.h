 * subcall flags
 *
 * When making subcalls, it is now possible to explicitely set the subcall
 * mode to a combination of the following flags using binary OR.
 *
 * In particular, the following combination of flags are to be known:
 *
 *  - for **subcall** having a similar behaviour to the subcalls of bindings
 *    version 1 and 2: afb_req_x2_subcall_pass_events|afb_req_x2_subcall_on_behalf
 *
 *  - for **subcall** having the behaviour of the **call**:
 *    afb_req_x2_subcall_catch_events|afb_req_x2_subcall_api_session
 *
 * Be aware that if none of mode  afb_req_x2_subcall_catch_events or
 * afb_req_x2_subcall_pass_events is set, subscrption to events will be ignored.
