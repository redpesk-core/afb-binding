 * Before version 3, the bindings had to declare at most
 * 3 separate functions to handle preinitialisation,
 * initialisation and unhandled events.
 *
 * Since version 4, bindings only need to implement one
 * main callback function to handle all these events.
 *
 * The new callback allows to define new events that were
 * previously missing:
 *  - root init (initialisation without declared API)
 *  - class readyness (when the required class(es) is(are) ready)
 *  - exiting (called before exiting)
